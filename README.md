# I.T.H.O.Sense

What is ITHOSense?

The I.T.H.O.Sensor is a multi sensor that neatly fits onto a wall plug. It monitors:

▲ Illumination (light intensity)

▲ Temperature

▲ Humidity

▲ Occupancy (movement)

No cameras or sound – so privacy is maintained.

Place them in strategic positions your home or workplace – get insight and understanding – set alerts to your phone or email.

Why? …

- Ever wondered if you are heating or cooling areas when nobody using them?
- Want to get alerted if your elderly parent does not get up at the time they normally do?
- Want to compare how fast each room in your house warms or cools down (insulation / draft proofing)
- Get notified of moisture (humidity) build up in cold areas.
- See Daily, Weekly, Monthly & Yearly customer activity in your shop or work area and compare changes and help predict busy periods and energy forecasts
- Automated home heating systems will compensate for poor insulation and draft proofing but this brings with it a cost. Find out where the problems are first with ITHOSense and fix them.
- Compare your site data with industry standard benchmarks.
- ITHOSense was originally created to prove to house builders that insulation in one area of a new house was not working effectively. Two ITHOSensors were placed, one in the bedroom and the other in the hall way near by. Over a few days temperature data was collected and graphed using the ITHOSense website.
